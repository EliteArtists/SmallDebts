    <h2>Why Unfair Charges Happen</h2>
    <p>Unfair charges are becoming increasingly common in the UK. Companies rely on consumers not knowing their rights — and many people simply pay because they feel intimidated or confused.</p>

    <p>Most unfair charges fall into one of these categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Incorrect or inflated fees</li>
        <li>Charges with no evidence</li>
        <li>Damage fees that were pre-existing</li>
        <li>Admin fees that are unlawful or excessive</li>
        <li>Penalties for things outside your control</li>
        <li>Estate agents or landlords inventing costs</li>
        <li>LeasePlan/Ayvens ‘wear and tear’ charges</li>
        <li>Businesses refusing to refund you</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Your Legal Rights</h2>
    <p>Under UK consumer law, a company cannot charge you a fee that is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unreasonable</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Not explained upfront</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Not supported by evidence</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Disproportionate to the issue</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Used as a penalty</strong> (penalties are illegal)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If a charge fails any of these tests, you are legally entitled to challenge it.</p>

    <h2>How to Fight an Unfair Charge (Step-by-Step)</h2>

    <h3>1. Request Evidence</h3>
    <p>You are legally entitled to see:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Invoices</li>
        <li>Photos</li>
        <li>Reports</li>
        <li>Breakdowns of costs</li>
        <li>Call logs or inspection notes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the company cannot provide evidence, the charge is unenforceable.</p>

    <h3>2. Ask for a Justification</h3>
    <p>Simply say: <em>“Please explain how this charge is reasonable and lawful.”</em></p>  

    <p>Most companies cannot justify their own fees.</p>

    <h3>3. Point Out Consumer Law</h3>
    <p>Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, terms must be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transparent</li>
        <li>Fair</li>
        <li>Proportionate</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Anything that resembles a penalty is unlawful.</p>

    <h3>4. Send a Formal Complaint</h3>
    <p>This is the step where most people give up — because writing the email is overwhelming.</p>
    <p><strong>This is exactly what Small Debts does for £12.50.</strong></p>

    <p>A properly written, legally-structured complaint forces companies to take you seriously. Many cases settle immediately.</p>

    <h3>5. Escalate to External Bodies (If Required)</h3>
    <p>Depending on the company, you may be able to escalate to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Financial Ombudsman Service</li>
        <li>Motor Ombudsman</li>
        <li>Property Ombudsman</li>
        <li>ICO (for data issues)</li>
        <li>County Court (for recovery)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When You Should NOT Pay a Charge</h2>
    <p>You should dispute the charge if any of the following are true:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You were not warned about it</li>
        <li>The fee is excessive</li>
        <li>It feels like a penalty</li>
        <li>The evidence doesn’t match the claim</li>
        <li>You feel pressured, threatened, or manipulated</li>
        <li>Other customers have complained about the same issue</li>
        <li>The company is refusing to explain the fee properly</li>
    </ul>
